# Create Token
This is a Solidity program that showcases the fundamental syntax and functionality of Solidity 

## Description
This program and contract is written in Solidity which is a language for developing Ethereum blockchain smart contracts. The contracts include a function to create a custom token

## Executing Program
We can use Remix as Solidity IDE to execute the program. Compile the code using the Solidity Compiler tab. Deploy the contract using the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

We'll use the contract by copying the account address and entering a value. Paste the address into the mind function, add a desired value, and click transact. Look at the balance, then use the burn function to deduct your balance by pasting the address and the amoun you want to reduce. After that, you can now try out the program
